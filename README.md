# Solana-NFT-price
A simple and functionable piece of code help you retrive Solana NFT price using Magic Eden API and other APIs.

## For beginners:
Installed python and pip, then use pip to install packages, here we need requests and tabulate. You can find the packages in pypi.org, e.g., [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/ )

Or you can simplely download the released .exe version, fell free to add your own nft collections by add their symbol -- you can find it in the urls of their Magic Eden pages.

Then you can just copy the code in .py files and open with python, remember to change the extension to .py and that's it.

## Description
The connections has a 12 seconds timeout and will catch http error while continue to the next task. The API may be slow sometimes maybe specific to some NFT projects? so this will save you a lot of time waiting. The process will be visible which is my farvorite feature in this project.
The main function has set to run in every 30 seconds. You can use ctrl + c to interrupt.
